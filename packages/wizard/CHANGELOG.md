## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 5d3eb13: Initial release of `@cipherstash/wizard` — AI-powered encryption setup for CipherStash, extracted from `@cipherstash/cli`.

  Run it once per project, after `stash init`:

  ```bash
  npx @cipherstash/wizard
  pnpm dlx @cipherstash/wizard
  yarn dlx @cipherstash/wizard
  bunx @cipherstash/wizard
  ```

  The wizard reads your codebase, asks which columns to encrypt, hands a surgical prompt to the Claude Agent SDK against the CipherStash-hosted LLM gateway, and runs deterministic post-agent steps (package install, `db install`, `db push`, framework migrations). Same behavior as the previous `stash wizard` command — just shipped as its own package so it doesn't bloat the cli's dependency tree.
