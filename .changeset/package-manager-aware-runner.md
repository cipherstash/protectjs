Show and execute commands using the detected package manager's runner (`npx` / `bunx` / `pnpm dlx` / `yarn dlx`) instead of always emitting `npx`. A user who runs `bunx @cipherstash/cli init` now sees a "Next Steps" panel that suggests `bunx @cipherstash/cli db install` and `bunx @cipherstash/wizard`, and the wizard's post-agent step both displays and shells out to `bunx @cipherstash/cli db push` (was: `Failed: npx @cipherstash/cli db push`). Wizard prerequisite messages and AI-agent error hints (e.g. on a 401, `Run: bunx @cipherstash/cli auth login`) follow the same rule. Detection sources are unchanged: `npm_config_user_agent` first, then lockfile, then `npx` fallback.
