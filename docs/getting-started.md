## Getting started

This getting started guide steps you through:

1. Installing and configuring Protect.js in a standalone project
2. Encrypting, searching, and decrypting data in a PostgreSQL database

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> **Prerequisites:** Before you start you need to have this software installed:
>
> - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
> - [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
> - [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) â€” see PostgreSQL's [documentation for installing](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

### Step 0: Basic file structure

The following is the basic file structure of the standalone project for this getting started guide.
In the `src/protect/` directory, we have the table definition in `schema.ts` and the Protect.js client in `index.ts`.

```
ðŸ“¦ <project root>
 â”œ ðŸ“‚ src
 â”‚   â”œ ðŸ“‚ protect
 â”‚   â”‚  â”œ ðŸ“œ index.ts
 â”‚   â”‚  â”” ðŸ“œ schema.ts
 â”‚   â”” ðŸ“œ index.ts
 â”œ ðŸ“œ .env
 â”œ ðŸ“œ cipherstash.toml
 â”œ ðŸ“œ cipherstash.secret.toml
 â”œ ðŸ“œ package.json
 â”” ðŸ“œ tsconfig.json
```

If you're following this getting started guide with an existing app, skip to [the next step](#step-1-install-protectjs).

If you're following this getting started guide with a clean slate, create a basic structure by running:

```bash
mkdir -p protect-example/src/protect
cd protect-example
git init
npm init -y
```

## Step 1: Install Protect.js

Install the [`@cipherstash/protect` package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cipherstash/protect) with your package manager of choice:

```bash
npm install @cipherstash/protect
# or
yarn add @cipherstash/protect
# or
pnpm add @cipherstash/protect
```

> [!TIP]
> [Bun](https://bun.sh/) is not currently supported due to a lack of [Node-API compatibility](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/issues/158). Under the hood, Protect.js uses [CipherStash Client](#cipherstash-client) which is written in Rust and embedded using [Neon](https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon).

Lastly, install the CipherStash CLI:

- On macOS:

  ```bash
  brew install cipherstash/tap/stash
  ```

- On Linux, download the binary for your platform, and put it on your `PATH`:
  - [Linux ARM64](https://github.com/cipherstash/cli-releases/releases/latest/download/stash-aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu)
  - [Linux x86_64](https://github.com/cipherstash/cli-releases/releases/latest/download/stash-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu)

> [!NOTE] 
> **You need to opt out of bundling when using Protect.js.**
>
> Protect.js uses Node.js specific features and requires the use of the [native Node.js `require`](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#requireid).
>
> You need to opt out of bundling for tools like [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/externals/), [esbuild](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/externals/), or [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/serverExternalPackages).
>
> Read more about [building and bundling with Protect.js](#builds-and-bundling).

### Step 2: Set up credentials

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure you have [installed the CipherStash CLI](#step-1-install-protectjs) before following these steps.

To set up all the configuration and credentials required for Protect.js:

```bash
stash setup
```

If you haven't already signed up for a CipherStash account, this will prompt you to do so along the way.

At the end of `stash setup`, you will have two files in your project:

- `cipherstash.toml`, which contains the configuration for Protect.js
- `cipherstash.secret.toml`, which contains the credentials for Protect.js

> [!WARNING]
> Don't commit `cipherstash.secret.toml` to git; it contains sensitive credentials.
> The `stash setup` command will append to your `.gitignore` file with the `cipherstash.secret.toml` file.

Read more about [configuration via TOML file or environment variables](./docs/reference/configuration.md).

### Step 3: Define your schema

Protect.js uses a schema to define the tables and columns that you want to encrypt and decrypt.

To define your tables and columns, add the following to `src/protect/schema.ts`:

```ts
import { csTable, csColumn } from "@cipherstash/protect";

export const users = csTable("users", {
  email: csColumn("email"),
});

export const orders = csTable("orders", {
  address: csColumn("address"),
});
```

**Searchable encryption:**

If you want to search encrypted data in your PostgreSQL database, you must declare the indexes in schema in `src/protect/schema.ts`:

```ts
import { csTable, csColumn } from "@cipherstash/protect";

export const users = csTable("users", {
  email: csColumn("email").freeTextSearch().equality().orderAndRange(),
});

export const orders = csTable("orders", {
  address: csColumn("address"),
});
```

Read more about [defining your schema](./docs/reference/schema.md).

### Step 4: Initialize the Protect client

To import the `protect` function and initialize a client with your defined schema, add the following to `src/protect/index.ts`:

```ts
import { protect } from "@cipherstash/protect";
import { users, orders } from "./schema";

// Pass all your tables to the protect function to initialize the client
export const protectClient = await protect(users, orders);
```

The `protect` function requires at least one `csTable` to be provided.

### Step 5: Encrypt data

Protect.js provides the `encrypt` function on `protectClient` to encrypt data.
`encrypt` takes a plaintext string, and an object with the table and column as parameters.

Start encrypting data by adding this to `src/index.ts`:

```typescript
import { users } from "./protect/schema";
import { protectClient } from "./protect";

const encryptResult = await protectClient.encrypt("secret@squirrel.example", {
  column: users.email,
  table: users,
});

if (encryptResult.failure) {
  // Handle the failure
  console.log(
    "error when encrypting:",
    encryptResult.failure.type,
    encryptResult.failure.message
  );
}

const ciphertext = encryptResult.data;
console.log("ciphertext:", ciphertext);
```

Run this with:

```bash
npx tsx src/index.ts
```

The `encrypt` function will return a `Result` object with either a `data` key, or a `failure` key.
The `encryptResult` will return one of the following:

```typescript
// Success
{
  data: {
    c: '\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\x61202020202020472aaf602219d48c4a...'
  }
}

// Failure
{
  failure: {
    type: 'EncryptionError',
    message: 'A message about the error'
  }
}
```

### Step 6: Decrypt data

Use the `decrypt` function to decrypt data.
`decrypt` takes an encrypted data object as a parameter.

```typescript
import { protectClient } from "./protect";

const decryptResult = await protectClient.decrypt(ciphertext);

if (decryptResult.failure) {
  // Handle the failure
}

const plaintext = decryptResult.data;
```

The `decrypt` function returns a `Result` object with either a `data` key, or a `failure` key.
The `decryptResult` will return one of the following:

```typescript
// Success
{
  data: 'secret@squirrel.example'
}

// Failure
{
  failure: {
    type: 'DecryptionError',
    message: 'A message about the error'
  }
}
```

### Step 7: Store encrypted data in a database

Encrypted data can be stored in any database that supports JSONB.

To store the encrypted data, specify the column type as `jsonb`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  email jsonb NOT NULL,
);
```
