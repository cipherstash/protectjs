# Protect.js schema

Protect.js lets you define a schema in TypeScript with properties that map to your database columns, and define indexes and casting for each column which are used when searching on encrypted data.

## Creating schema files

You can declare your Protect.js schema directly in TypeScript either in a single `schema.ts` file, or you can split your schema into multiple files. It's up to you.

Example in a single file:

```
ðŸ“¦ <project root>
 â”œ ðŸ“‚ src
 â”‚   â”œ ðŸ“‚ protect
 â”‚   â”‚  â”” ðŸ“œ schema.ts
```

or in multiple files:

```
ðŸ“¦ <project root>
 â”œ ðŸ“‚ src
 â”‚   â”œ ðŸ“‚ protect
 â”‚   |   â”” ðŸ“‚ schemas
 â”‚   â”‚     â”” ðŸ“œ users.ts
 â”‚   â”‚     â”” ðŸ“œ posts.ts
```

## Understanding schema files

A schema represents a mapping of your database, and which columns you want to encrypt and index. Thus, it's a collection of tables and columns represented with `csTable` and `csColumn`.

The below is pseudo-code for how these mappings are defined:

```ts
import { csTable, csColumn } from "@cipherstash/protect";

export const tableNameInTypeScript = csTable("tableNameInDatabase", {
  columnNameInTypeScript: csColumn("columnNameInDatabase"),
});
```

## Defining your schema

Now that you understand how your schema is defined, let's dive into how you can configure your schema.

Start by importing the `csTable` and `csColumn` functions from `@cipherstash/protect` and create a new table with a column.

```ts
import { csTable, csColumn } from "@cipherstash/protect";

export const protectedUsers = csTable("users", {
  email: csColumn("email"),
});
```

### Searchable encryption

If you are looking to enable searchable encryption in a PostgreSQL database, you must declaratively enable the indexes in your schema by chaining the index options to the column.

```ts
import { csTable, csColumn } from "@cipherstash/protect";

export const protectedUsers = csTable("users", {
  email: csColumn("email").freeTextSearch().equality().orderAndRange(),
});
```

### Nested objects

Protect.js supports nested objects in your schema, allowing you to encrypt **but not search on** nested properties. You can define nested objects up to 3 levels deep.
This is useful for data stores that have less structured data, like NoSQL databases.

You can define nested objects by using the `csValue` function to define a value in a nested object. The value naming convention of the `csValue` function is a dot-separated string of the nested object path, e.g. `profile.name` or `profile.address.street`.

> [!NOTE]
> Using nested objects is not recommended for SQL databases, as it will not be searchable.
> You should either use a JSON data type and encrypt the entire object, or use a separate column for each nested property.

```ts
import { csTable, csColumn, csValue } from "@cipherstash/protect";

export const protectedUsers = csTable("users", {
  email: csColumn("email").freeTextSearch().equality().orderAndRange(),
  profile: {
    name: csValue("profile.name"),
    address: {
      street: csValue("profile.address.street"),
      location: {
        coordinates: csValue("profile.address.location.coordinates"),
      },
    },
  },
});
```

When working with nested objects:
- Searchable encryption is not supported on nested objects
- Each level can have its own encrypted fields
- The maximum nesting depth is 3 levels
- Null and undefined values are supported at any level
- Optional nested objects are supported

> [!WARNING]
> TODO: The schema builder does not validate the values you supply to the `csValue` or `csColumn` functions.
> These values are meant to be unique, and and cause unexpected behavior if they are not defined correctly.

## Available index options

The following index options are available for your schema:

| **Method** | **Description** | **SQL equivalent** |
| ----------- | --------------- | ------------------ |
| equality   | Enables a exact index for equality queries. | `WHERE email = 'example@example.com'` |
| freeTextSearch   | Enables a match index for free text queries. | `WHERE description LIKE '%example%'` |
| orderAndRange   | Enables an sorting and range queries index. | `ORDER BY price ASC` |

You can chain these methods to your column to configure them in any combination.

## Initializing the Protect client

You will use your defined schemas to initialize the EQL client.
Simply import your schemas and pass them to the `protect` function.

```ts
import { protect, type ProtectClientConfig } from "@cipherstash/protect";
import { protectedUsers } from "./schemas/users";

const config: ProtectClientConfig = {
  schemas: [protectedUsers], // At least one csTable is required
}

const protectClient = await protect(config);
```
